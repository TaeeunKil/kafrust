# Roadmap

kafrust milestones are ordered by implementation risk and user-visible value. The project should keep Kafka concepts familiar to existing Kafka users while building a native Rust implementation underneath.

## M0 Foundation

Goal: make the repository ready for steady development.

Scope:

- Cargo workspace
- initial crate or module layout
- license
- Rust toolchain or MSRV policy
- CI for `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test`

Exit criteria:

- the workspace builds
- formatting, linting, and tests can run locally and in CI
- future work has a clear crate/module home

## M1 Protocol Core

Goal: encode and decode Kafka wire-format messages without needing a broker.

Scope:

- primitive wire types
- strings, nullable strings, bytes, and nullable bytes
- compact strings, compact bytes, compact arrays, and tagged fields
- request and response headers
- ApiVersions messages
- Metadata messages

Exit criteria:

- byte-level protocol tests cover the implemented primitives
- known request/response fixtures are checked where practical
- protocol code is separated from high-level client ergonomics

## M2 Broker Roundtrip

Goal: prove kafrust can talk to a real Kafka broker.

Scope:

- TCP connection
- request and response framing
- correlation IDs
- client ID handling
- ApiVersions request/response
- Metadata request/response
- basic error decoding

Exit criteria:

- kafrust can connect to a local Kafka broker
- ApiVersions roundtrip succeeds
- Metadata roundtrip succeeds for at least one topic

## M3 Producer MVP

Goal: provide a familiar minimal producer for Kafka users.

Scope:

- `Producer::builder()`
- `bootstrap_servers`
- `client_id`
- topic, key, and value records
- Produce request
- `acks=1`
- metadata-based leader routing
- basic retry behavior

Exit criteria:

- an example can produce a record to a real topic
- producer API exposes Kafka concepts directly
- basic metadata refresh and retry behavior are documented

## M4 Consumer MVP

Goal: provide a minimal consumer path before implementing full consumer groups.

Scope:

- Fetch request
- direct topic/partition assignment
- offset selection
- record batch decoding
- stream-like record consumption API

Exit criteria:

- an example can fetch records from a real topic partition
- offsets and partitions are visible to users
- record decoding is covered by focused tests

## Later Milestones

Open these after M4 is meaningfully underway:

- M5 Consumer Group Alpha: FindCoordinator, JoinGroup, SyncGroup, Heartbeat, OffsetFetch, OffsetCommit, and rebalance handling
- M6 Production Behavior: timeouts, retry policy, metadata refresh, reconnects, failover, error classification, tracing, and backpressure
- M7 Public Alpha: examples, API docs, integration tests, crates.io release preparation
