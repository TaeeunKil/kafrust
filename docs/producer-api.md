# Producer API Direction

The producer API should preserve Kafka concepts while using Rust builders and typed options.

```rust
use kafrust::{Acks, ProducerConfig, ProducerRecord};

let mut producer = ProducerConfig::new(["localhost:9092"])
    .client_id("orders-api")
    .acks(Acks::All)
    .build()
    .await?;

let record = ProducerRecord::to("orders")
    .key("order-123")
    .value("created");

let metadata = producer.send(record).await?;
println!("{}-{}@{}", metadata.topic(), metadata.partition(), metadata.offset());
```

The public model intentionally keeps Kafka terms visible:

- topic
- partition
- key
- value
- headers
- timestamp
- acknowledgements
- record metadata

The first producer implementation should stay byte-first. Serialization adapters can be added later without forcing serde or another encoding choice into the core client.

Run the opt-in producer example against a local broker and an existing or auto-created topic:

```bash
KAFRUST_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=localhost:9092 KAFRUST_TOPIC=kafrust-smoke cargo run -p kafrust --example producer_send
```

Current implementation status:

- `ProducerConfig`, `ProducerRecord`, `Acks`, and `RecordMetadata` are public API types.
- `ProducerConfig::build` creates a producer backed by a Kafka broker connection.
- `Producer::send` performs metadata lookup, connects to the partition leader, encodes ProduceRequest v2, and decodes ProduceResponse v2.
- The first wire path uses the legacy MessageSet v1 record format, so record headers are rejected until RecordBatch encoding is added.
- `acks=0` is rejected for now because the current client request loop expects a broker response.
- Stale metadata style produce errors are retried once after refreshing metadata.
